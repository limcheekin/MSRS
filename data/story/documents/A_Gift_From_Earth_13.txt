The governor's palace was jammed with hurrying people, a scene of
confusion that upset Zotul. The clerk who took his application for
an interview was, he noticed only vaguely, a young Earthwoman. It
was remarkable that he paid so little attention, for the female
terrestrials were picked for physical assets that made Zurian men
covetous and Zurian women envious.
  
 
  "The governor will see you," she said sweetly. "He has been expecting
you."
  
 
  "Me?" marveled Zotul.
  
 
  She ushered him into the magnificent private office of the governor
of Lor. The man behind the desk stood up, extended his hand with a
friendly smile.
  
 
  "Come in, come in! I'm glad to see you again."
  
 
  Zotul stared blankly. This was not the governor. This was Broderick,
the Earthman.
  
 
  "I—I came to see the governor," he said in confusion.
  
 
  Broderick nodded agreeably. "I am the governor and I am well acquainted
with your case, Mr. Masur. Shall we talk it over? Please sit down."
  
 
  "I don't understand. The Earthmen...." Zotul paused, coloring. "We are
about to lose our plant."
  
 
  "You were about to say that the Earthmen are taking your plant away
from you. That is true. Since the House of Masur was the largest and
richest on Zur, it has taken a long time—the longest of all, in fact."
  
 
  "What do you mean?"
  
 
  "Yours is the last business on Zur to be taken over by us. We have
bought you out."
  
 
  "Our government...."
  
 
  "Your governments belong to us, too," said Broderick. "When they could
not pay for the roads, the telegraphs, the civic improvements, we took
them over, just as we are taking you over."
  
 
  "You mean," exclaimed Zotul, aghast, "that you Earthmen own everything
on Zur?"
  
 
  "Even your armies."
  
 
  "But
   
   why
   
  ?"
