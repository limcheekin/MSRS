Upstairs, the wind was blowing into the apartment and I closed the
windows, mainly to shut out the tumult and the shouting. Nat had
brightened up considerably.
  
 
  "I'll stay for one more drink and then I'm due at the office," he said.
"You know, I think this would make an item for the paper." He grinned
and nodded toward the pandemonium.
  
 
  When he was gone, I noticed it was getting dark and turned on the desk
lamp. Then I saw the curtains. They were all tied in knots, except
one. That was tied in three knots.
  
 
  All
   
   right
   
  , I told myself, it was the wind. But I felt the time had
come for me to get expert advice, so I went to the phone to call
McGill. McGill is an assistant professor of mathematics at a university
uptown and lives near us. He is highly imaginative, but we believe he
knows everything.
  
 
  When I picked up the receiver, the line sounded dead and I thought,
   
   more
   
  trouble. Then I heard a man cough and I said hello. McGill's
voice said, "Alec? You must have picked up the receiver just as we were
connected. That's a damn funny coincidence."
  
 
  "Not in the least," I said. "Come on over here. I've got something for
you to work on."
  
 
  "Well, as a matter of fact, I was calling up to ask you and Molly—"
  
 
  "Molly's away for the week. Can you get over here quick? It's urgent."
  
 
  "At once," he said, and hung up.
  
 
  While I waited, I thought I might try getting down a few paragraphs of
my novel—perhaps something would come now. It did, but as I came to a
point where I was about to put down the word "agurgling," I decided it
was too reminiscent of Gilbert and Sullivan, and stopped at the letter
"R." Then I saw that I had unaccountably hit all four keys one step to
the side of the correct ones, and tore out the page, with my face red.
  
 
  This was absolutely not my day.
