In the story, names do not carry significant social or personal implications, and there is no indication that the protagonist’s name affects their social status or interactions within the narrative. The story focuses on the protagonist’s experiences on a distant planet, including the physical and emotional challenges of survival, rather than on naming conventions or societal reactions to names. The narrative does not explore how others respond to the protagonist's name, nor does it suggest that such a name influences identity, status, or relationships. Therefore, the question of how others react upon hearing the protagonist's name is not addressed or implied in the text.
