The principle of mental privacy is significant in the story exploring the boundaries between reality and perception amid cosmic upheaval because it underscores the danger of invasive observation and the erosion of personal autonomy. In the narrative involving telepathic surveillance, such as the probe into Evelyn Kane’s mind, mental privacy becomes a threshold between individual agency and external control. The characters, particularly Evelyn and Perat, navigate a world where thoughts are not merely private but are subject to scrutiny, manipulation, or manipulation by systems of power. When Evelyn’s false memories are probed and her deception is detected, it reveals that reality is not objective but constructed through perception and psychological manipulation. This reflects the cosmic upheaval in that the universe is not indifferent to human consciousness—it actively engages with it, often through mechanisms that violate privacy. The story suggests that true freedom and self-determination emerge only when individuals can protect their inner worlds from being read, exploited, or used as tools in larger conspiracies. Thus, mental privacy becomes both a personal and cosmic necessity—its violation signals a collapse of individual will and a descent into a world where perception is dictated, not chosen. In this context, preserving mental privacy is not just a moral stance, but a survival mechanism in a reality where perception is weaponized and identity is fluid.
