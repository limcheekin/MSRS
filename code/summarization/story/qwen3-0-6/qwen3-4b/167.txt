Johnny Haldane is not a character in any of the provided story chapters. Therefore, there is no narrative involving Johnny Haldane, nor any events that unfold for him as he navigates space or confronts a treacherous allure. The stories presented focus on diverse characters and plots, such as Cadet Marshall Farnsworth's first spaceflight, Bruce's encounters with alien-like visions on Mars, Judy Bolton's haunted fountain mystery, and other isolated incidents, but none involve a character named Johnny Haldane. The question is based on a fictional or misattributed narrative not present in the text.
