The cylinder is not a physical object in the story, but a metaphorical reference to the "power cylinder" or "power shell," a central concept in the narrative involving a corrupt political system and Martian domination. In the story, Mury reveals that the power cylinder is a secret technological or energy source that was intended to save Earth from economic collapse and provide it with independence from Mars. However, Mury argues that the power cylinder is not being delivered as planned, and its failure signifies a deeper betrayal by Earth's leaders who have sold the planet to Mars for profit. The significance of the power cylinder lies in its symbolic role as a representation of Earth's potential for self-sufficiency and freedom. Its supposed sabotage or failure reflects the corruption of Earth's leadership and the exploitation of its people by external powers. Mury's actions to uncover and disrupt the planned delivery of the power cylinder underscore the theme of resistance against oppression and the belief that true salvation comes not from external forces, but from the collective will of the people to reclaim their sovereignty.
