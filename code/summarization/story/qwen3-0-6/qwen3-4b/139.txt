The lockets in the story involving Miss Carroll and Bram serve as a central symbol of connection, memory, and unfulfilled longing. The locket, given by Bram to Miss Carroll when he was courted, represents a promise and a bond that transcends time and physical absence. Bram, a reclusive figure, feared thunder and was haunted by visions of an intelligent, misty presence in the mountains—something that he believed was alien and dangerous. His fear and actions, including killing Doran who "saw" the same thing, reflect a deep-seated belief in the necessity of eliminating the unknown to protect human progress. The locket becomes a tangible relic of that unspoken connection, a physical manifestation of Bram's emotional and psychological struggle. When Miss Carroll keeps the locket, it symbolizes her enduring loyalty to him and her belief in the truth of his story. The locket acts as a bridge between the past and present, linking the two characters across time and circumstance, and underscores the story’s theme of human connection in the face of isolation and the unknown. It is not merely an object, but a vessel of memory, hope, and unresolved emotion.
