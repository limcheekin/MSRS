The story does not involve a lone watchman on an asteroid facing alien invaders or a conflict with extraterrestrial life. There is no setting described involving an asteroid, alien invaders, or a lone watchman in such a scenario. The provided chapters cover a variety of unrelated narratives—such as a young man on a planet, a lone watchman on Earth, a space pioneer, a Martian colony, and a haunted house—none of which include an asteroid setting or alien invasion. Therefore, the setting of a lone watchman on an asteroid facing alien invaders and conflict does not exist in any of the stories presented.
