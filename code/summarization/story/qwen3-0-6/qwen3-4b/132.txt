There is no mention of a mysterious musician or a band in any of the provided chapters. The stories cover a range of settings and themes—such as colonization on Mars, a psychological thriller involving telepathy and alien encounters, a space mission, and a mystery about a haunted fountain—but none involve a musician or a band in a unique venue on Mars. Therefore, the relationship between a mysterious musician and a band in such a setting does not exist in these texts.
