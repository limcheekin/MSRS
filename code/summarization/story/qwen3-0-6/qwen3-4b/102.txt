Eric finds himself on Tintera, a city characterized by its strange beauty and underlying danger. The narrative describes Tintera as a planet with spring-like conditions, yet it is also marked by a sense of isolation and peril. The environment is depicted as both alluring and hazardous—its natural beauty is evident in the green forests and the road with animal tracks, but the danger is implied through the isolation of the setting and the grim fate of those who survive the colonized planets. Eric, having been dropped from the ship at age fourteen, must now survive alone, relying on his wits and survival instincts. The city, or rather, the planet, is not fully described with human structures, but the presence of a road, tracks, and the need to find shelter or companionship suggests a settlement with a fragile, possibly decaying infrastructure. The danger lies in the unknown—both the environment and the people who may inhabit it. The tone of the story is one of quiet dread, where beauty is intertwined with the threat of death or loss, making Tintera a place of strange, haunting beauty and hidden danger.
