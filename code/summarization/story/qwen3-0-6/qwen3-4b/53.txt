The Andrews family, who are cast into a precarious situation far from home, are in a state of isolation and vulnerability as they face the harsh realities of life on a distant planet. They are not in a position of power or control, but rather are at the mercy of the environment and their own survival instincts. Their relationship with those in their employ—such as the workers or caretakers they encounter—reflects one of dependence and tension. The family members, having been selected and sent into this isolated setting, are stripped of familiar social structures and must rely on others for survival, creating a dynamic of mutual survival rather than cooperation. The narrative emphasizes that the family's situation is not one of comfort or stability, but of existential struggle, where the presence of others—whether as allies or as threats—adds to the emotional and psychological weight of their experience. Their relationship with those in service is marked by a lack of trust and a constant awareness of being observed or exploited. Ultimately, the family’s isolation amplifies their vulnerability, and their interactions with those in their employ become fraught with suspicion, making survival a solitary and often painful endeavor.
