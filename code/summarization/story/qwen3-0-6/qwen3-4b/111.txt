The story does not explicitly explore societal expectations of women in a world shaped by gender roles and colonial challenges. Instead, it centers on individual experiences of isolation, survival, and personal struggle in a technological or post-colonial context. While some chapters feature female characters—such as Evelyn Kane, Judy Dobbs, or Venie Morlock—there is no systemic analysis of how gender norms constrain or empower women. For instance, Evelyn’s experience with telepathic surveillance and forced participation in violence reflects a dehumanizing system, but it is not framed through a gendered lens. Similarly, Judy’s narrative involves her personal quest for identity and unresolved emotional trauma, but it does not contrast or critique societal expectations placed on women. The story emphasizes survival and personal agency over structural gender roles. Thus, the narrative fails to address the complex interplay between gender, colonialism, and societal norms in a way that would reveal differing expectations about women. The absence of such a framework limits the story’s engagement with the broader sociopolitical dynamics the question implies.
