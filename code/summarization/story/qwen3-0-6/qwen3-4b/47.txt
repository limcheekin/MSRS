The narrator in the story is not directly related to the enigmatic voice that urges him to defy societal norms in his dreams. Instead, the voice emerges from the narrator's own subconscious, symbolizing internal conflict and a desire to break free from the constraints of routine and societal expectations. The narrator's dreams are filled with vivid, surreal imagery—such as a geological job, a dream involving Doran, and a mysterious presence in the mountains—that suggest a deep psychological undercurrent. The voice, though not physically present, represents the narrator’s inner self, expressing a yearning for truth, freedom, and connection beyond the surface of reality. This connection is not with a specific person or entity, but with the narrator’s own suppressed desires and fears. Thus, the relationship is not one of external influence but of self-discovery, where the enigmatic voice functions as a manifestation of the narrator's repressed thoughts and dreams, urging him to challenge norms and explore deeper, more authentic experiences.
