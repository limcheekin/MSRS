Roddie does not utilize his screwdriver or hammer as tools for survival or conflict in the story. The narrative focuses on Roddie’s survival in a dystopian setting, where he navigates isolation, physical hardship, and psychological strain after being dropped onto a planet. His tools—specifically the screwdriver and hammer—are not used in a literal or mechanical sense to solve problems or defend himself. Instead, these items symbolize his preparedness and resourcefulness, as he carefully checks and organizes his gear before departure, indicating a practical, grounded mindset. However, there is no direct action involving the use of the screwdriver or hammer in the survival or conflict scenarios. The story emphasizes his emotional and mental resilience—such as riding in search patterns, enduring loneliness, and managing relationships—rather than physical tool use. Thus, Roddie’s tools remain symbolic of readiness, not active instruments in navigating survival or conflict.
