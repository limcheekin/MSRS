In the story, technology plays a central and oppressive role in shaping society, particularly in the context of children's lives. The world described is one where children are systematically separated from their families and sent to colonized planets at age fourteen, a process orchestrated by the "Great Ship" system. This technological framework is not merely a tool for exploration or survival—it functions as a mechanism of social control. Children are prepared from a young age to endure harsh, isolated conditions, with no emotional or familial connection, as the Ship's design ensures they are "a person who can take care of himself." The technology of the Ship—its gravity systems, life support, and navigation—is both a source of survival and a symbol of detachment. The children are forced into a state of emotional and psychological isolation, where their pasts are deliberately erased. They are conditioned to believe that survival is their only purpose, and the technological environment reinforces this by stripping them of autonomy, memory, and identity. The narrative reveals that technology is not neutral—it is deeply entwined with societal control, ensuring that children are shaped into resilient, emotionally detached individuals, who view their past as irrelevant. Thus, technology in this society functions as a tool of social engineering, maintaining population stability by eliminating emotional dependency and enforcing a rigid, survival-based worldview.
