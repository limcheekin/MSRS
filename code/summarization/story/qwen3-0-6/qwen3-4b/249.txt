The story does not feature government regulations that directly impact a man struggling with his memories and life changes. Instead, it presents a narrative centered on psychological and emotional turmoil, particularly in the context of a man’s personal journey and mental state. While there are elements of societal rules—such as the mandatory space colonization policy in one story where young men are sent to planets at age 14—these are framed as institutional procedures rather than governmental regulations that directly shape a person’s memories or life. The narrative explores internal conflict, identity, and the erosion of self through trauma and memory, not through structured governmental oversight. Therefore, no significant government regulations are imposed in the story that directly affect the protagonist’s struggle with memory or life transitions. The backdrop of societal rules is more symbolic than regulatory, and the focus remains on individual psychological experience rather than institutional control.
