Celeste's attitude toward her family in a world filled with cosmic uncertainties is initially one of detachment and emotional distance. She is deeply aware of the dangers and alienation of life beyond Earth, particularly the harsh, unpredictable environments of the planets. Her fear of being stranded or never returning—such as the fear of being on a planet for a whole month—reflects a sense of isolation and anxiety. However, her attitude shifts when she encounters other members of her group, such as Venie Morlock, and the dynamics of their interactions reveal a growing awareness of connection and shared struggle. Though she does not openly express affection or closeness, her actions—like cutting Venie out of the group to avoid a confrontation—show a protective instinct and a desire to preserve personal agency in a world where trust and loyalty are fragile. This change in attitude reflects a deeper emotional engagement with her family, despite the cosmic uncertainties. She begins to value human bonds, even in moments of danger or solitude, suggesting that her perception of family evolves from isolation to a more active, protective, and emotionally aware presence.
