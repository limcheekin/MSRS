The story takes place primarily on a distant planet and aboard a massive, futuristic vessel known as the "Great Ship." The planet, Tintera, is depicted as a harsh, alien environment—featuring gravity that causes physical discomfort, vegetation that appears unnaturally invasive and "grubby," and a pervasive, unpleasant stench that makes the planet deeply unpleasant for the protagonist. The setting emphasizes the isolation and psychological strain of being alone in an unfamiliar, hostile world. The Great Ship, in contrast, is a highly structured, controlled society where young cadets are sent out at age fourteen to survive on colonized planets for one month. The ship's environment is one of strict discipline and societal engineering, where survival and self-reliance are emphasized to maintain mental and physical stability. The setting thus reflects a contrast between the controlled, artificial world of the ship and the chaotic, terrifying reality of the outer planets. The mysterious stranger, Mury, appears in the latter part of the story, introducing a new setting on Pi Mesa—a desolate, overgrown area with a hidden, dangerous mission. This location serves as a place of confrontation, where the protagonist is forced to confront not just the physical dangers of the environment, but also moral and existential dilemmas. The narrative uses these varied settings to explore themes of isolation, survival, and the psychological toll of being caught between duty and personal freedom.
