The story involving a man's unexpected encounters and a mysterious code hidden within a library book does not exist in the provided chapters. All the chapters describe separate stories—such as a man's survival on a distant planet, a secret resistance movement, a telepathic conspiracy, a man's first spaceflight, a mysterious dream involving a mountain on Mars, a haunted house and a ghostly fountain, and others—none of which involve a man discovering a code in a library book. Therefore, there is no plot that matches the question posed.
