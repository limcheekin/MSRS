The newspapers are an important part of the story involving a mysterious island and a girl who has lived in isolation for years because they serve as a crucial link between the isolated girl and the outside world, providing both information and a sense of connection. In the narrative, the girl's life is one of solitude, shaped by her isolation and the mysterious events surrounding her. The newspapers act as a lifeline, offering details about the world beyond the island, including news of a missing child, a mysterious island, and a girl who has lived in seclusion. These reports not only confirm the girl’s presence and her strange circumstances but also introduce elements of mystery and danger, such as a missing child and a threatening presence on the island. The media reports become a narrative device to show how the girl's isolation is both a physical and psychological state, and how the outside world views her. The newspapers, therefore, function as a bridge between reality and the girl’s internal world, reinforcing the theme of isolation and the search for identity. They also provide a sense of urgency and consequence, as the world begins to take notice of her, prompting the girl to confront her reality and possibly take action. In this way, the newspapers are not just background detail—they are central to the story’s emotional and thematic development.
