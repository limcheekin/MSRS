There is no character named "Mom" in the provided story chapters. The narrative centers on various individuals such as Cadet Marshall Farnsworth, Sim and his family, Bruce and the crew on Mars, Evelyn and Perat, and Judy Dobbs, each in distinct contexts involving space, survival, or mystery. While some characters experience familial or emotional connections—such as Marshall's parents, Sim's parents, or Judy's grandparents—there is no explicit or central figure named "Mom" who is defined by characteristics within a peculiar town. The stories are set in diverse environments—space colonies, post-apocalyptic settings, alien planets, and isolated towns—and none describe a town filled with unusual happenings where a character named Mom plays a role. Therefore, based on the text, the question about "who is Mom and what are her characteristics in the context of a peculiar town filled with unusual happenings" cannot be answered, as no such character or setting exists in the provided chapters.
