The members aboard the life skiff with Malcolm are Malcolm himself, Venie Morlock, and Jimmy D. After being marooned on the distant planet Tintera, Malcolm, Venie, and Jimmy form a small group as they navigate the harsh environment. While Malcolm initially separates from Jimmy D. due to their longstanding rivalry, he later chooses to cut Venie out of the group to avoid conflict, demonstrating a focus on self-reliance and survival. The trio is left to survive on their own, with Malcolm taking the lead in search and survival efforts. The group's dynamics are shaped by their personal conflicts and the extreme conditions of the planet, making their situation both dire and complex.
