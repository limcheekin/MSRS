The setting of the tale of greed and the consequences of seeking treasure in space is a harsh, isolated, and alien environment—a barren, uncharted planet within a distant solar system. This world is devoid of life, with no vegetation, no atmosphere, and a desolate, cold landscape. The environment is described as hostile and unforgiving, with gravity that causes physical discomfort, such as aching joints and a constant fear of falling. The planet emits a foul odor, making it uninviting and oppressive. The only signs of life or order are remnants of human civilization—such as abandoned equipment, broken tools, or ruins of a colony—left behind by those who sought treasure and failed. The journey to this planet is part of a larger, controlled system where young individuals are sent into space to survive for a month, only to face the brutal reality of isolation and survival. The setting underscores the theme of human greed and its ultimate failure, as the pursuit of treasure leads to physical and emotional ruin in an indifferent, lifeless world. The planet becomes a symbol of the futility of greed—where all effort ends in desolation, and the only reward is a crushing sense of loneliness and loss.
