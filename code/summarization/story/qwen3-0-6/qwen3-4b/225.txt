The story revolves around a man's unsettling discovery in his town and the strange indifference of the people around him. The narrative centers on a young man named Sim, who, after a traumatic experience with his parents, finds himself in a world where life is fleeting and violent. He witnesses the death of his parents and the brutal, unthinking violence of other children, which leads to a deep existential crisis. As he navigates this reality, he forms a fragile bond with a girl named Lyte, whom he sees as a potential love interest and future partner. However, the environment is hostile and violent—children are constantly at odds with one another, and Sim is constantly threatened by enemies like Chion, who mocks and threatens him. The story’s plot centers on Sim's growing awareness of the impermanence and brutality of life, as well as the sudden emergence of a deep emotional connection with Lyte. Despite the chaos and the constant threat of violence, Sim’s emotional bond with Lyte becomes a symbol of hope and love in a world devoid of peace. The unsettling discovery is that life is short, violent, and unpredictable, and the people around him—especially those who survive—seem indifferent to the suffering and loss. This indifference, combined with the surreal and violent nature of the world, makes the experience profoundly unsettling.
