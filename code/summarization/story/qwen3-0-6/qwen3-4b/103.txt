The setting of the story involving a man who finds himself in a strange, captivating city that is both alluring and menacing is a futuristic, post-colonial metropolis known as Dynamopolis. This city emerges as a dark, industrialized urban landscape where economic exploitation and political oppression are central themes. It is a place where the corrupt power structures of a global government—particularly the Martian-dominated regime—exert control over human labor and resources, turning Earth into a vast labor pool. The city is described through its stark, utilitarian architecture and its oppressive atmosphere, reflecting a society governed by manipulation, surveillance, and systemic injustice. The man, Mury, navigates this city as part of a clandestine resistance movement, confronting the machinery of control and uncovering the truth behind the suppression of Earth's autonomy. The city's alluring nature lies in its promise of technological advancement and economic revival, while its menacing qualities stem from its role as a site of imperial exploitation and ideological subjugation. The setting functions as a symbolic representation of a world where power is wielded not through democratic means but through economic coercion and ideological domination.
