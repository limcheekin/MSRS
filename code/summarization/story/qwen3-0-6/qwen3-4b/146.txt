The setting of the story involves a crew of explorers landing on the desolate planet Tintera, a barren world with no visible signs of life or civilization. The planet is described as gray-green and forested in early exploration, but the crew quickly discovers it to be devoid of vegetation, animals, or human presence. The environment is hostile and alien, with strange, unidentifiable creatures and a pervasive sense of isolation. The explorers, including the narrator, are unprepared for the planet's harsh conditions, as the gravity is off, and the terrain is unstable. The only signs of past life are remnants of a forgotten civilizationâ€”such as an ancient road, tracks of horses and wheels, and evidence of domesticated animals, suggesting a once-thriving society. The presence of horses, which were included in the colony plan, implies a past agricultural or domestic society. The planet's silence, its lack of movement, and the absence of any living beings reinforce the idea of a forgotten, abandoned civilization. The explorers' journey is not only physical but psychological, as they struggle with loneliness and existential dread in the vast, lifeless expanse, further emphasizing the desolation and mystery of the setting.
