The setting of the story is a desolate, alien planet known as Tintera, which is a barren and hostile environment. The planet is characterized by its harsh conditions: gravity that feels unnatural and unstable, making movement difficult and disorienting, and an oppressive, pervasive stench that permeates the air. The landscape is described as gray-green and forested, with narrow, sandy roads and tracks left by horses, indicating a once-living, now abandoned colonial outpost. The environment is physically and emotionally taxing, with the protagonist enduring loneliness, isolation, and the constant struggle to survive. The planet lacks signs of life beyond the small, isolated human presence, and the setting emphasizes the isolation and psychological strain of being stranded on a barren, uninviting world. The atmosphere is one of dread, alienation, and existential fear, as the protagonist battles not only the environment but also the unknown dangers of the planet, including the notorious space pirate. The setting underscores the vulnerability and desperation of the human experience in a hostile, uncivilized world.
