The story involves a soldier who is sent to a peaceful colony on the planet Tintera as part of a structured program where young individuals are dropped onto planets at age fourteen to survive and adapt. The soldier, initially skeptical and distressed by the unfamiliar environment, begins to explore the colony, riding in search of people and a place to stay. Over time, he discovers a road and learns that horses were included in the colony’s founding for practical reasons, as they are essential for transportation and survival in the absence of industry. As he moves through the landscape, the tension rises as he begins to sense an unseen, possibly hostile force in the colony. The environment grows increasingly ominous—vegetation appears to be sentient or reactive, and the planet's quiet peace masks a growing unease. The soldier's arrival, combined with the colony’s isolation and the presence of an unseen threat, creates a rising sense of danger. The plot centers on the soldier’s growing awareness that the colony is not truly peaceful, and that the threat—possibly alien or environmental—is actively watching, waiting, and may be manipulating or endangering the inhabitants. The soldier’s journey becomes one of discovery and survival, as he uncovers a hidden reality beneath the surface of the colony’s tranquility.
