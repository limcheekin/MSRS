The provided story chapters do not contain any information about a character named Garrett or a figure known as "Star." Therefore, there is no evidence or context in the text to support the claim that Garrett created a false identity as "Star" or that he made anyone believe in this false identity. The narrative focuses on themes of isolation, survival, and mystery in alien environments, such as the colonized planets, space travel, or psychological struggles, but none of these involve the specific scenario described in the question. As a result, the question cannot be answered based on the given text.
