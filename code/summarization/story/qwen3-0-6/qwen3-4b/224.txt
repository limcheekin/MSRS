The setting of the story revolves around a harsh, unforgiving landscape of a distant planet, specifically Tintera, which is described as a cold, alien world with dense forests, rocky terrain, and a hostile environment. The protagonist, a wayfarer who has been sent to this planet as part of a colonial mission, navigates a challenging terrain marked by isolation and danger. The environment is not only physically unforgiving—its vegetation includes "little grubby things" that crawl and "stink" constantly—but also emotionally and psychologically taxing, contributing to the protagonist's sense of alienation and dread. The journey through the forest and the eventual discovery of a road signify a struggle to survive and find connection. This barren, hostile landscape mirrors the inner turmoil of the protagonist, who grapples with personal loss, strained relationships, and the emotional weight of returning to a world that may not welcome him. The setting thus functions as both a physical and symbolic backdrop, emphasizing the difficulty of reintegration and the isolation that comes with personal and familial struggles.
