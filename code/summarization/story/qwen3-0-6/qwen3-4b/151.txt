The setting of the story is an ancient, mysterious city filled with remnants of a long-lost civilization, characterized by its eerie stillness and the haunting presence of forgotten technologies and structures. The city exudes an atmosphere of isolation and timelessness, where the silence is palpable and the ruins seem to whisper secrets of a past long abandoned. The setting is both alien and familiar—its architecture suggests advanced engineering, yet it appears untouched by time, as if the civilization that once thrived there simply vanished without a trace. The environment is described through sensory impressions: the cold, the dust, the way shadows stretch unnaturally in the dim light, and the quiet that seems to absorb sound. This setting evokes a sense of isolation and existential unease, as if the city is a preserved tomb of a forgotten world, still holding onto the echoes of a civilization that may have once been as sophisticated as it was tragic. It is not merely a backdrop but a character in itself—an ancient, sentient presence that challenges the understanding of time, progress, and human destiny.
