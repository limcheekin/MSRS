Ryd is a young man caught in a dangerous political and ideological struggle involving a secret organization known as "We." He is not a central figure in a traditional narrative but rather a passive participant in a larger conspiracy. Ryd's character is defined by his fear, uncertainty, and vulnerability. He is manipulated by Mury, a radical figure who believes Earth is being exploited by Mars through the sale of its resources and labor. Mury convinces Ryd that the planned "power cylinder" is not a salvation but a tool of colonial exploitation, and that it must be sabotaged. To achieve this, Mury offers Ryd fifty thousand credits, a sum that becomes a critical incentive given Ryd's desperate circumstances. Ryd, fearing for his life and seeing no other option, agrees to join Mury and take part in a dangerous mission to disrupt the power cylinder's delivery.

Ryd's involvement is not driven by ideology but by survival and coercion. He is not a leader or a visionary, but rather a pawn in a larger plan. His actions—such as following Mury, carrying out a mission, and accepting the reward—are motivated by fear and a sense of powerlessness. The story reveals that "We" is a clandestine, violent force that operates outside the law, taking no chances and using extreme measures to achieve its goals. Ryd's role is to carry out these operations, not to lead or understand the broader conflict. Thus, Ryd embodies the tragic figure of the individual who, despite being aware of danger, is compelled to participate in a world of hidden power struggles and ideological warfare. His character reflects the themes of manipulation, fear, and the loss of agency in the face of larger, systemic forces.
