The story does not contain a narrative about a young man returning to his childhood home where he discovers tragedy and confronts his past. Therefore, there is no significance to an "old man" in such a story as described in the provided chapters. The chapters offered are from various standalone stories, none of which feature a young man's return to his childhood home, nor a confrontation with past tragedy involving an old man. The content focuses on themes such as isolation, survival, psychological trauma, and existential dread in contexts like space travel, colonialism, and alien encounters, but not the specific narrative described in the question. As a result, the question cannot be meaningfully answered based on the provided material.
