Sim gains his knowledge and absorbs his surroundings through direct, sensory immersion in the harsh, fleeting world of short-lived life. From the earliest moments of consciousness, he observes and internalizes the physical and emotional realities of existence—feeling the expansion of his fingernails, the adjustments in his cells, and the growth of his bones and sinew. These bodily processes become symbolic of life’s relentless progression and decay. Sim learns through personal experience, not abstract thought, connecting each physical sensation to a deeper understanding of life’s impermanence. He associates his parents' gradual decline into a mummy-like state with his own fear of aging and death. His emotional growth is fueled by witnessing his mother’s final movements and his father’s inability to rise. He forms intimate bonds with his sister, Dark, and discovers the emotional complexity of life through fleeting interactions—such as the moment when he first sees the girl Lyte, whose name becomes a symbol of love and connection in a world devoid of permanence. Sim’s knowledge is not derived from formal education or memory, but from a continuous, embodied awareness of life’s fleeting nature. Through these experiences, Sim internalizes the harshness and brevity of existence, turning each moment into a vital lesson in survival and human connection.
