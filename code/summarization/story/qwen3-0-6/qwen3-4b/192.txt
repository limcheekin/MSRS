The theme of marriage in the story is not explicitly explored, as the narrative does not center on a man’s struggles with his wife or his decision to replace her with a duplicate. Instead, the story focuses on themes of isolation, identity, and the psychological toll of prolonged separation, particularly in the context of space colonization. The idea of a duplicate or a replacement for a spouse is absent, and there is no discussion of marital conflict, emotional abandonment, or the emotional dynamics of a relationship under extreme conditions. The chapters depict individuals facing existential and emotional challenges—such as loneliness, fear, and alienation—but these are tied to broader themes of survival and isolation rather than marital strife or substitution. Therefore, the theme of marriage is not present or developed in this story.
