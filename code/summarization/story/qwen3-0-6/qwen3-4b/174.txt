The setting of the story is a seemingly idyllic yet dangerous planet, Tintera, inhabited by a small, isolated colony. The planet features a springtime environment, with gray-green forested hills and a narrow, sandy road that becomes a central location for exploration. The world is described as hostile and alien, with strange vegetation, unsettling animal life, and an atmosphere that feels both foreign and oppressive. The explorers, including the narrator, face physical and psychological challenges—such as disorienting gravity, isolation, and the constant threat of danger—highlighting the planet's deceptive beauty and underlying peril. The isolation of the colony and the lack of contact with the outside world amplify the sense of danger and mystery, making Tintera a place of both wonder and existential risk.
