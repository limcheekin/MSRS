The story revolves around Bruce, a crew member on a mission to Mars, who struggles with a lack of special abilities compared to his peers. Unlike others who excel in physical or technical feats, Bruce is described as ordinary, relying on intuition and dreams rather than skill. His journey takes a dark turn when he experiences vivid dreams of an intelligent, misty presence on Mars, which he believes to be a sign of alien life. When Doran, another crew member, reacts with aggression and shoots at the mysterious form, Bruce feels compelled to act in defense, ultimately killing Doran. This act stems from Bruce’s deep-seated fear of alien life threatening human advancement. His psychological breakdown, rooted in paranoia and a belief in alien influence, leads to a conflict with the crew and a confrontation with the alien presence. The story explores themes of isolation, fear of the unknown, and the destructive nature of human fear in the face of perceived alien intelligence. Bruce’s struggle reflects a broader human condition—being overwhelmed by an unknown and being forced to make drastic decisions in the absence of clear abilities or guidance.
