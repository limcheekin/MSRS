In the story, individuals who lack special abilities are not explicitly addressed, as the narrative centers on a world where most people possess unique powers. However, the context implies that such individuals are not marginalized or seen as inferior. Instead, the society values self-reliance and capability, as reflected in the Shipâ€™s system, where all young individuals undergo rigorous training to ensure they can survive and thrive independently. Those who cannot survive or adapt are deemed unfit to contribute to society, not because they lack ability, but because they fail the trials of preparation and survival. The system is designed to maintain stability and mental resilience in a closed society. Thus, individuals without special abilities are not viewed as inherently weak or useless, but rather as part of a broader human experience where personal development and survival skills are prioritized over innate powers. The narrative does not provide a detailed view of how such individuals are treated, but the underlying philosophy suggests that value is based on adaptability and resilience, not on possession of extraordinary abilities.
