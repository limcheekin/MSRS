Patti Gray is deeply unsettled by the prospect of life on a distant planet, as she describes the environment as oppressive and alien. She finds the gravity on the planet to be wrongâ€”either causing her legs and feet to ache or making her fear she will trip and break her neck. She is repelled by the creatures that crawl on the ground, which she finds creepy, and is horrified by the planet's stench, noting that every planet smells, which makes her feel physically unwell. Her discomfort is compounded by the fact that she is being sent to a planet where no one else is expected to survive, and she is aware that the Ship's system discards those who cannot survive for a month, viewing them as too foolish or unlucky to be useful. Despite her fear and discomfort, Patti Gray is not helpless. She is resourceful and actively checks her gear and plans her survival, showing determination to endure. Throughout the story, her emotional and physical reactions to the planet's conditions reflect her deep anxiety about being alone and unprepared in a hostile, unfamiliar environment. Her journey is one of a desperate escape from a perilous situation, as she fights to survive and find others, even as she is emotionally and physically drained by the environment.
