Steffens decides to engage with the mysterious mechanical beings on the desolate planet because he believes they may hold crucial information about the planet's environment, the mission's objectives, or the fate of the crew. Despite the planet's harsh conditions—its unrelenting gravity, pervasive stench, and unsettling vegetation—Steffens is driven by a sense of duty and curiosity. His mission is not merely survival, but to understand the world he has been dropped into. The mechanical beings, though alien and enigmatic, represent a potential source of answers to the unknown. Their presence suggests a deliberate design or intelligence in the planet’s ecosystem, which could offer clues about how the colony was established or what lies beneath the surface. Steffens' prior experiences on other planets have taught him that environments are often more complex than they appear, and he is willing to confront the unknown to uncover truths that might be essential to the success—or survival—of future colonization efforts. Thus, his engagement is not born from bravery alone, but from a rational pursuit of knowledge in the face of isolation and uncertainty.
