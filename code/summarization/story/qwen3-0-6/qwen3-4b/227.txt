The mysterious hanged figure in the story does not play a role in the narrative of an ordinary man's unsettling encounter with an unexplainable event in his town. The story provided, centered on Cadet Marshall Farnsworth’s first space journey, does not include any such figure. There is no mention of a hanged figure, nor any event involving a person hanging or being observed in a town setting. The narrative focuses on themes of space travel, fear, isolation, and human emotion during a historic flight, with no supernatural or mysterious figures tied to an ordinary man’s encounter in a town. Therefore, the role of a hanged figure is entirely absent from this story.
