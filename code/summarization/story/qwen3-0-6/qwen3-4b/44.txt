Bill and Elizabeth do not appear in the provided story, and therefore do not contribute to any unfolding events involving an ancient secret society or its mysterious implications. The text consists of multiple standalone narratives—such as the space mission, the Martian colony, the secret society on Mars, and the haunted house mystery—none of which feature characters named Bill and Elizabeth. As a result, there is no connection or contribution made by these characters within the context of the story as described.
