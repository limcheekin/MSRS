Sim and his sister Dark share a deep, protective bond in a world where life is fleeting and survival is constant. Dark acts as a caretaker and guardian, taking responsibility for Sim after their mother's decline and father's frailty. She ensures Sim's survival by feeding him, holding him, and guiding him through their harsh, short-lived existence. Her actions reflect a deep maternal instinct, as she fiercely protects Sim from danger, such as when she slaps away the boy Chion who tries to steal his food, demonstrating that enemies are made quickly and must be fought for survival. Dark also teaches Sim about the necessity of vigilance and the fleeting nature of life, warning him that enemies are made over stolen food, gifts, or opinions, and that life’s brevity demands swift action. Their relationship is one of survival and mutual dependence, shaped by the harshness of their environment and the inevitability of death. Dark’s love and care are evident in her actions, such as when she walks with Sim at the funeral procession and holds him tightly, showing that she sees him as a vital part of her world. Together, they face the harsh realities of their existence, with Dark embodying the resilience and strength required to survive in a world where life is short and every moment must be used wisely.
