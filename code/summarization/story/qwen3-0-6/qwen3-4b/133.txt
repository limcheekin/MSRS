The story provided does not contain a narrative about Jimmie, John, or a band, nor does it involve any context where Johnâ€™s continued involvement with a band is meaningful or emotionally significant. Therefore, the question about why it is important for John to continue playing with the band in the midst of their struggles cannot be answered based on the given text. The chapters described involve themes of isolation, survival, and alienation in post-colonial or frontier settings, such as on planets or in isolated colonies, but there is no reference to a band, a musical group, or a character named Jimmie or John. As such, the question is not supported by the provided content.
