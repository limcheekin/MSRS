Mury handles himself with intense resolve and strategic determination throughout the story, positioning himself as a revolutionary agent against a corrupt system. In a high-stakes conflict involving personal survival and broader societal injustice, Mury acts as a catalyst for resistance, exposing the exploitation of Earth by Martian interests. He directly confronts Ryd, a fellow disillusioned individual, by revealing the truth behind the "power cylinder" plan—how it is not a salvation but a betrayal, selling Earth as a labor pool to Mars. Mury’s actions are driven by a fierce moral clarity: he refuses to accept the system’s manipulation and instead initiates a direct, dangerous action to subvert it. He demonstrates no hesitation or fear, leading Ryd into a mission to sabotage the Martian warship, offering him fifty thousand credits as a means of control and survival. Mury’s calm yet calculated demeanor masks a deep, almost fanatical commitment to justice. He does not rely on rhetoric or passive resistance but instead engages in immediate, violent action—killing a guard, breaking into a restricted area, and using a flame pistol to destroy evidence. His leadership is rooted in a belief that the masses are being sold out and must be awakened. Mury’s character is defined by his refusal to be a passive victim, instead taking initiative, assuming risk, and acting with cold precision, making him a central figure in a struggle between oppression and revolutionary resistance.
