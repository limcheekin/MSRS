The story that explores themes of morality and intelligence in a future society grappling with the consequences of past wars is not directly represented in the provided chapters. While several narratives touch on themes of survival, isolation, and societal structure—such as the colonial drop-down system in one story or the moral ambiguity of conquest in another—none explicitly explore the interplay of morality and intelligence in a society shaped by the aftermath of wars. The chapters depict isolated individuals facing physical and psychological challenges, such as the colonist on a distant planet or the space cadet preparing for a historic journey, but they do not present a cohesive narrative centered on a society reevaling its moral foundations due to past conflicts. Therefore, no specific plot emerges from the provided texts that aligns with the question's focus on a future society confronting the consequences of war through moral and intellectual reflection.
