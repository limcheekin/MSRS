John Smith is not interested in holes because he perceives them as a metaphor for the alien, unsettling environments of the planets he lands on. The "holes" he observes—such as the barren, uninviting terrain, the strange vegetation, the unnatural gravity, and the pervasive stench—represent the dissonance and discomfort he feels in these unfamiliar worlds. These perceptions are not literal but symbolic, reflecting his deep psychological unease and existential discomfort with the idea of being isolated and exposed to conditions that defy human norms. The "holes" signify both physical and emotional voids—spaces where stability, safety, and familiarity are absent. This emotional response is tied to his belief that planets are inherently hostile and unlivable, making them a source of dread rather than curiosity. His interest, therefore, is not in the literal structures of holes, but in the psychological and existential implications of encountering worlds that challenge human survival and sanity. The concept of holes thus becomes a manifestation of his alienation and fear of the unknown, reinforcing his belief that life on planets is not sustainable or humanly tolerable.
