The setting of the story involves a group of humans who are dropped onto a distant planet, Tintera, following a historical conflict with an alien race. The planet is described as having a harsh, alien environment with unusual gravity, which causes physical discomfort such as aching arches and calves and a constant fear of tripping. The planet's atmosphere is noted to be uninviting and stinky, contributing to the characters' discomfort. The environment includes strange, small creatures that crawl on people, which adds to the sense of unease and alienness. The inhabitants of the planet are described as being in a state of isolation, with the humans having to survive alone for a month after being dropped from a massive ship. The planet's vegetation and terrain are described as barren and hostile, with only a narrow road and tracks of horses and wheels indicating human activity. The setting emphasizes the isolation and survival challenges of the humans, who must navigate an unfamiliar, hostile world with limited resources and no immediate contact with their home civilization. The planet is a stark contrast to the ship, which provides a controlled, familiar environment, highlighting the disorientation and vulnerability of the humans on Tintera.
