The President in the story does not directly communicate with the public, as the narrative centers on a man and woman returning to a devastated Earth after a long journey in space. Their experiences are marked by physical discomfort and emotional disorientation—gravity, stench, and unfamiliar vegetation make the planet feel hostile. The man, reflecting on his prior training, expresses deep aversion to planetary life, describing it as "wretched" due to its unnatural conditions. He is prepared for the trip through systematic, regimented training, where young adults are sent to colonize planets at age 14, with the understanding that those who fail or cannot survive are deemed unfit for society. This reflects a rigid, survival-based societal structure designed to maintain mental and physical stability in a closed system. When they return, the man’s communication is minimal and internal, as he struggles to process the reality of the world. There is no direct public communication from a "President" in this story—rather, the narrative presents a personal, introspective account of survival, isolation, and disillusionment. The story does not include a political or public figure engaging in policy or speech, so any notion of a President’s communications is absent or fictionalized. The focus remains on the individual’s physical and emotional struggle, not on governance or public messaging.
