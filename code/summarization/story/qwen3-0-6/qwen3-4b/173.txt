The members of the Explorer follow strict health and survival criteria while navigating the dangerous environment of Tintera. These criteria include maintaining physical and mental alertness, ensuring the safety of essential gear such as a sonic pistol, signal device, saddle, and food supplies, and adhering to a structured survival plan. The explorers follow a systematic approach: staying alive, finding a suitable location for a month, and joining forces with others. They navigate the terrain using a spiral search pattern, which allows them to cover ground efficiently while minimizing risk. The presence of horses is noted as a critical health and survival factor, as they provide a reliable and efficient mode of transport in an environment where vehicles and infrastructure are absent. The explorers are also acutely aware of the planet's hazards—such as gravity anomalies, unidentifiable flora, and the absence of breathable air—leading them to prioritize movement and vigilance. Their survival strategy is grounded in practicality and preparedness, relying on instinct, experience, and a deep understanding of the risks inherent in the environment. These criteria ensure that the explorers can endure the harsh conditions and remain functional for the full month.
