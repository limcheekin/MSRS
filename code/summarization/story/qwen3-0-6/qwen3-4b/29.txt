In the context of the story, "pre-civilization" refers to a hypothetical, primitive state of human existence that predates the development of organized societies, laws, governance, and complex technology. The children in the narrative express fascination with historical violence and the idea of a time before civilization, suggesting that such a time is characterized by chaos, lack of structure, and survival-based behavior. This concept is not tied to any specific historical or archaeological record but instead represents a speculative notion—something akin to a primal era where humans lived in isolation, without institutions or shared cultural norms. The story emphasizes how these children are drawn to such ideas because they reflect on human origins and the violent, often random nature of early human conflict. Their discussions about pre-civilization highlight a fascination with brutality and chaos as inherent to early human life, contrasting with the structured, regulated, and often mechanical life of the future. Thus, "pre-civilization" in this narrative is not a place or a time with defined features, but rather a symbolic and imaginative state representing the absence of societal order—where violence is normalized, and survival is paramount. It embodies a sense of primal fear and uncertainty, illustrating how the children perceive history as a progression from chaos to order, and their fascination with pre-civilization stems from its raw, unregulated nature.
