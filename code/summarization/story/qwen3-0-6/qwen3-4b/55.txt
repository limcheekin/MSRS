The story involving a man stranded on an alien planet centers on a young man who is part of a group of adolescents sent to colonize distant planets as part of a closed society system. After being dropped on the planet Tintera, he faces physical and psychological challenges, including disorientation, confusion, and the alien environment. The planet’s gravity is described as disturbing—either causing pain or making movement precarious—and the environment is filled with strange, crawling creatures and an overpowering stench. The man is initially isolated and fearful, but he begins to adapt by searching for people, resources, and shelter. He discovers a road and learns that horses were included in the colonization effort for practical purposes, such as farming and transport. As he navigates the planet, he grapples with loneliness, survival instincts, and the uncertainty of whether he will survive the one-month mission. The plot is one of survival, alienation, and the psychological toll of being cut off from civilization, emphasizing themes of isolation, adaptation, and the human struggle to maintain sanity in an unfamiliar and hostile environment.
