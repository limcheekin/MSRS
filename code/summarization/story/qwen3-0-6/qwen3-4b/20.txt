The plot revolves around a young man named Jimmy D. who is part of a generation of adolescents sent on a one-month mission to colonize distant planets aboard the "Great Ship." The story follows Jimmy as he grapples with feelings of resentment and a deep desire for escape after being forcibly cast onto the planet Tintera. The bleak future of the world is characterized by isolation, environmental discomfort, and the loss of human connection. Jimmy's journey is marked by his struggle to survive, his growing sense of alienation from both the planet and his peers, and his internal conflict between loyalty to his group and a yearning to flee. The narrative emphasizes his emotional turmoil and the dehumanizing nature of the colonial system, where individuals are treated as expendable units. As he searches for companions and tries to find a place to survive, Jimmy confronts the harsh reality of a future where escape is not just physically impossible, but emotionally and psychologically unattainable. His resentment toward the system and his longing for freedom reflect a broader critique of a future society that strips individuals of agency and meaning.
