The irony of the "Makers" in the story lies in their self-proclaimed role as protectors of Earth, yet their actions reveal a profound contradiction: they are not creators or benefactors, but rather agents of exploitation and dehumanization. The "Makers" are portrayed as a secretive, powerful force that claims to be safeguarding Earth from Martian domination by selling its resources, but in reality, they are complicit in the degradation of Earth's value by treating its people as mere labor or commodities. Their belief that Earth is a "pool of labor" ready to be exploited by Martian landowners underscores the irony that they, who claim to be defenders of humanity, are themselves complicit in the system that reduces human life to a disposable, replaceable workforce. This is further emphasized when they speak of the "power cylinder" as a salvation, only to reveal it as a tool of domination. The irony deepens when the narrative shifts to the Makers' actual behaviorâ€”sabotaging Earth's economy and promoting a system where humans are treated as slaves, not partners. Thus, the "Makers" are ironically not makers of progress or peace, but makers of oppression, reinforcing the story's central critique of systems that claim to protect freedom while systematically devaluing human dignity.
