In the story, the State plays a central role in maintaining societal order by enforcing strict conformity and eliminating individuals who fail to meet societal or functional standards. The State ensures population stability by systematically removing those deemed unfit—those who are mentally or physically incapable of surviving independently—through a process of mandatory assignment to remote colonies at age fourteen. These individuals are dropped onto uncharted planets, and if they do not survive or adapt, they are effectively eliminated. This system ensures that only individuals capable of self-sufficiency remain in the society. The State uses a structured, impersonal system where individuals are identified not by names but by numeric designations, reflecting a dehumanized, bureaucratic society. The State’s role is thus one of total control and purification, where conformity is enforced through state-mandated trials, and individuality is suppressed in favor of collective survival and order. The numeric identification strips away personal identity, reducing people to functional units within a larger, state-driven machine. In this society, the State is both the enforcer of discipline and the architect of a controlled, stable, and efficient population.
