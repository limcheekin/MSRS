Martin Kesserich copes with the loss of Mary Alice by withdrawing into a state of emotional and physical isolation, focusing on survival and the practical tasks of his new environment. After being dropped on Tintera, he immediately begins searching for other people and a place to survive, reflecting his deep sense of loneliness and grief. He rides in a spiral search pattern, driven by a need to find others, to locate a safe place to live for a month, and to join forces with others. His actions—such as cutting Venie Morlock out of the group and immediately beginning to check his gear—show a focus on routine and survival, which serves as a coping mechanism to avoid confronting his emotional pain. The loss of Mary Alice is not directly addressed through dialogue, but the narrative implies that his isolation and relentless survival efforts are a way to manage the grief. His emotional state is marked by a sense of detachment and a refusal to dwell on the past, as he turns his attention to the present and the immediate task of staying alive. This pragmatic focus, while effective in the context of survival, also highlights the depth of his emotional trauma and his struggle to process the loss.
