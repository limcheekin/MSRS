After being dropped on the planet Tintera, he faces isolation, harsh environmental conditions, and the psychological strain of being far from Earth. The gravity is described as disorienting, with the terrain feeling alien and the planet itself emitting an unpleasant, unclean smell. The protagonist endures physical and emotional struggles, including the fear of not returning, the loneliness of being alone, and the constant search for human contact. He rides in search of other survivors or safe settlements, encountering only odd animals and eventually finding a road, which becomes a crucial path to survival. The story highlights his internal conflictâ€”his homesickness, his longing for connection, and the fear of failure. Unexpected dangers include the possibility of starvation, exposure, or being lost in a hostile environment.
