The setting of the story involving a man's unsettling discovery in a town where something sinister seems to be happening around him is a desolate, isolated Martian colony on a planet devoid of life or signs of life, where the inhabitants have been dropped by a massive ship and are cut off from Earth. The town is a barren, hostile environment with no visible plant or animal life—only fungi and lichen in crevices—creating an atmosphere of silence and isolation. The central mystery arises from the residents' shared, unexplained experiences, such as dreams of battles with evil beings in caves beneath their homes, and the sudden, inexplicable death of a man, Doran, after he allegedly saw something alive and intelligent outside the mountain. The townspeople, including Bruce, claim they saw a misty, translucent, intelligent presence that Doran feared and tried to destroy, reinforcing the idea that something otherworldly or alien exists in the environment. The story unfolds in a place where no contact with the outside world has occurred, and the town's inhabitants are driven by a deep-seated fear and a belief that they are being watched or attacked by unknown, hostile forces. This isolation and the recurring dreams and visions suggest that the setting is not just physically barren, but spiritually and psychologically oppressive, with the sinister presence manifesting through dreams, hallucinations, and the unexplained deaths of individuals. The entire environment feels like a test of human endurance against an alien, intelligent, and possibly sentient force.
