The Earthmen are desolate because they are sent to colonize alien worlds where their hopes for revival are crushed by hostile, indifferent environments and the harsh realities of survival. In the story, Earthmen are dropped onto planets with no prior contact, facing gravity that harms their bodies, alien vegetation that feels creepy and unnatural, and pervasive stench that makes the environment unbearable. The isolation and constant danger of dying—such as the fact that many never return alive—create deep emotional desolation. The system of sending young Earthmen to planets forces them to endure a month of survival without support, with no guarantee of return. This cycle of abandonment, combined with the psychological toll of being alone in a hostile world, leads to a profound sense of hopelessness and despair. The lack of meaningful connection, the constant threat of death, and the absence of any real chance for revival or return make Earthmen feel alienated and emotionally broken, highlighting the desolation of a world where human hope is systematically extinguished.
