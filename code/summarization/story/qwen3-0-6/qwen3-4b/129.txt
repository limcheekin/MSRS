Isobar Jones is not a character in any of the provided story chapters. The narrative fragments presented involve distinct stories set in various contexts—such as a remote lunar outpost, a Martian colony, a space mission, a haunted house, or a futuristic Earth colony—yet none of these stories feature a character named Isobar Jones. The details of the lunar outpost narrative describe a young man (referred to as "the narrator") who is dropped onto a planet, experiencing isolation, physical discomfort, and psychological strain, but no character by the name of Isobar Jones appears in this or any other chapter. Therefore, Isobar Jones does not exist as a character in these stories, and no events involving him are described.
