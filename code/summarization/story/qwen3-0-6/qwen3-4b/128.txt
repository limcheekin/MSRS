The setting of the story revolves around a man working in a distant outpost on a colonized planet, specifically Tintera. This remote location is part of a broader human colonization effort, where young individuals are sent to distant worlds as part of a systematic program. The outpost is isolated, with the man, the narrator, traveling from a ship called the Ship, which is a massive vessel transporting colonists to new planets. The planet Tintera is described as having harsh environmental conditionsâ€”strange gravity that causes physical discomfort, pervasive and unpleasant smells, and strange, unclean vegetation that makes the man feel uneasy. The setting is both physically and psychologically challenging, emphasizing the alienation and disorientation of life on a distant frontier. The man's experience is marked by a sense of loneliness and longing for the comforts of home, which are contrasted with the barren, uninviting environment of the planet. The outpost serves as a symbol of human expansion into the unknown, where survival and resilience are tested. The story unfolds against the backdrop of a future society that relies on systematic, often brutal, colonization, highlighting the emotional and physical toll of living far from civilization.
