Barry Barr undergoes significant physical and emotional changes during his journey on the hostile planet Tintera. Initially, he is deeply uncomfortable with the planet’s harsh conditions, describing the gravity as "wrong," noting that it causes aches and makes movement unpredictable. He finds the environment alien and unsettling, especially the abundance of small, crawling creatures that "just look for you to crawl on," which he finds "creepy." The planet’s stench and the oppressive silence of the landscape further contribute to his sense of isolation and unease. As he adapts, Barry shifts from fear and frustration to a more pragmatic and determined mindset. He begins to systematically search for survivors, focusing on survival, finding people, and locating a place to establish a temporary shelter. His journey is marked by a psychological transformation—from a state of despair and disorientation to one of resilience and purpose. Through this, he becomes more self-reliant, taking initiative in his survival efforts and embracing the challenge of the environment. His internal struggle reflects a journey from helplessness to agency, ultimately demonstrating a transformation from a passive observer to an active, determined survivor of the planet’s hostile terrain.
