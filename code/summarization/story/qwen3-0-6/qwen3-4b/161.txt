The story does not mention a "new world order" or "Equalization Laws" in the context of a future population crisis. These concepts are absent from the provided chapters, which focus on individual experiencesâ€”such as isolation on alien planets, psychological strain during space travel, survival on colonized worlds, and personal conflicts in a post-humanity setting. The narrative centers on themes of survival, isolation, and human resilience rather than on political or societal systems like a new world order or population control laws. Therefore, based solely on the given text, there is no information about such systems or policies.
