The story explores the challenges faced by a group of Earthmen who venture to a mysterious and hostile planet, encountering unforeseen transformations and conflicts. The narrative centers on a group of Earth-bound colonists who are sent to a hostile, alien planet as part of a long-term colonization effort. The planet, Tintera, presents extreme environmental conditions—such as unnaturally low or high gravity, pervasive stench, and an abundance of strange, crawling life forms—that cause physical and psychological distress. The colonists, including the narrator, endure isolation, disorientation, and a profound sense of vulnerability, as they struggle to survive the harsh environment and maintain their mental stability. 

As the story unfolds, the characters face not only external dangers but internal conflicts, such as deep-seated rivalries and personal tensions. The narrator's strained relationship with Jimmy D., rooted in mutual distrust and a history of conflict, illustrates how interpersonal dynamics deteriorate under extreme conditions. The planet's alien ecosystem forces the colonists to adapt in ways that challenge their preconceptions of survival, leading to both physical and psychological transformations. The narrative ultimately portrays a group of humans grappling with existential fears, isolation, and the breakdown of their original identities in the face of an environment that defies their understanding. This creates a profound exploration of human resilience and the psychological toll of alienation and survival in the unknown.
