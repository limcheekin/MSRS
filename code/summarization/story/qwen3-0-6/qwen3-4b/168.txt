The story does not mention "ekalastron" or "No. 97" in any context involving space travel, pirates, or a beautiful siren luring spacemen to their doom. Therefore, there is no relevant information to connect ekalastron or No. 97 to such a narrative. The provided chapters involve space travel, colonial exploration, psychological tension, and personal conflict, but none reference a siren, a number like 97, or an element named ekalastron. The concept of ekalastron appears to be either a misstatement or a fabricated reference not present in the text. Consequently, the question cannot be answered based on the given material.
