Opperly and Farquar are alike in their deep moral conflict and personal struggle with the consequences of advanced technology and isolation, particularly in the context of the colonized planets and the Ship's mission. Both characters are shaped by the harsh, morally ambiguous environment of the Ship, where survival is measured not by empathy but by individual endurance and self-reliance. They both grapple with the trauma of being cast into alien, uncontrolled environments—Opperly on a distant planet, facing loneliness and physical discomfort, while Farquar is emotionally and psychologically burdened by the reality of being part of a system that values survival over human connection. 

Their differences lie in their responses to these conditions. Opperly, driven by instinct and a sense of duty, adapts to the planet through practical survival strategies, maintaining a quiet, observational stance. Farquar, however, is consumed by internalized guilt and moral questioning, especially regarding the violence and sacrifice required in the colonization effort. While Opperly accepts the harshness of the world as a given, Farquar questions its legitimacy, making him more introspective and ethically conflicted. This difference reflects a divergence in how each character interprets the moral implications of technological advancement: Opperly sees it as a tool for survival, while Farquar sees it as a mechanism of dehumanization and control. Ultimately, both are products of a world that demands sacrifice, but only Farquar fully confronts the moral cost—highlighting a deeper internal struggle between obedience and conscience.
