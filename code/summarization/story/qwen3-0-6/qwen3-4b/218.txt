The narrative involving a lone watcher's encounter with strange beings on an asteroid does not include any equipment. The story, centered on Bruce and his experiences on Mars, focuses on psychological and emotional themes rather than technological gear. Bruce's encounter with a misty, intelligent presence on the planet is described through dreams and personal reflections, not through the use of tools or devices. There is no mention of any instruments, sensors, weapons, or gear used during the encounter. The story emphasizes internal conflict, hallucinations, and the psychological impact of isolation, rather than physical equipment. Therefore, no equipment is used in the narrative.
