The story involves a group of people who are dropped onto a distant celestial body, Tintera, as part of a controlled experiment by a vast ship. They are not sent as volunteers but as part of a systematic program where individuals are isolated at age fourteen and subjected to a month-long survival test on a new planet. The narrative centers on the protagonist's personal struggle with the harsh, alien environment—its strange gravity, creepy vegetation, and foul smells—highlighting the psychological toll of isolation. The group must navigate the unfamiliar terrain, seeking shelter, food, and connection with others, while confronting internal conflicts, such as rivalry with Jimmy D. and the emotional strain of being separated from their former life. The plot unfolds as the protagonist discovers a road, leading to a potential path for survival or escape, and reflects on the purpose of the experiment: to test human resilience and adaptability in extreme conditions. The story emphasizes the emotional and physical challenges of survival, the loss of control, and the fear of never returning, all while maintaining a tone of quiet despair and resilience. Ultimately, the central theme is the human struggle to survive and maintain identity when stripped of familiar society and support.
