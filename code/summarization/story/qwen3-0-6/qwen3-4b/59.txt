The setting of the story revolves around a man named the narrator who is thrust into an unfamiliar, hostile alien world across the galaxy. This world is not one of comfort or familiarity—instead, it is characterized by physical discomfort, psychological unease, and environmental danger. The narrator describes the gravity as being "always wrong," causing constant pain in the body, such as aching arches and calves or a fear of tripping on fluff. The environment is overrun with strange, potentially dangerous creatures—small, grubby things that crawl and look for him—which he finds deeply unsettling. The air and the planet itself stink, and the narrator explicitly states that "planets make me feel wretched." The setting is isolated and unstructured, with no reliable systems or signs of civilization. The man is dropped on a planet for a month, and he must survive alone, with no support, while navigating a world where even basic survival is uncertain. The narrative emphasizes the emotional and physical toll of being out of one's element—a world that is not only alien in appearance but in its very nature, where danger, loneliness, and disorientation dominate. This creates a sense of existential dread, where the man is not just facing a physical threat but a profound sense of alienation and vulnerability in a vast, indifferent cosmos.
