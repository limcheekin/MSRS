The setting of the story involving a diplomatic mission and the complexities of youth politics on a unique planet is the planet Tintera. This world is part of a colonial system where young individuals, aged fourteen, are sent on a diplomatic and survival mission to a newly colonized planet as part of a structured program. The narrative unfolds in a post-scarcity, isolated environment where youth are stripped of childhood comforts and forced into survival, fostering early political and social development. The setting is defined by its harsh physical conditions—unstable gravity, alien flora, and an oppressive atmosphere—mirroring the psychological strain of adolescence in a high-stakes, politically charged environment. The mission structure, where youth are sent to assess and adapt to alien conditions, reflects the complexities of youth politics, as they must navigate interpersonal conflicts, survival instincts, and the moral weight of their actions in a society that depends on their resilience. Tintera thus functions as both a physical and symbolic frontier, representing the tension between individual agency and systemic control in a youth-driven political ecosystem.
