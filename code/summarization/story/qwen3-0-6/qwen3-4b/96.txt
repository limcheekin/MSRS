In the story, the United Universe does not have formal, planet-specific rules established by different societies, as the narrative focuses on individual experiences of isolation, survival, and psychological strain rather than on societal governance. Instead, the most significant "rules" are not imposed by planets but are dictated by the structured, interplanetary society aboard the Ship. These rules—such as dropping cadets to colonized planets at age fourteen and requiring them to survive for a month—serve as a form of societal control and social engineering. The rationale is to ensure that every individual is physically and mentally resilient, capable of self-sufficiency, and thus prepared for the harsh realities of frontier life. This system eliminates weak or unprepared individuals, maintaining population stability by filtering out those deemed unfit. The complexity of societal norms and taboos is not explored through cultural rules on planets, but through the psychological and emotional challenges of isolation, fear, and the loss of connection to home. The experience of being dropped onto a planet—where the environment is described as alien, stinky, and hostile—mirrors the internal struggle of the characters, emphasizing that societal rules are more about survival and mental discipline than about cultural or ethical taboos. Thus, the "rules" are practical, utilitarian, and rooted in survival, not in the preservation of diverse cultural norms.
