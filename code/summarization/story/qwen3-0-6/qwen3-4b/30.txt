The plot of the story involving Ryd centers on his entanglement in a dangerous conspiracy to sabotage the Martian power cylinder, a critical component intended to save Earth from economic collapse. Ryd, a seemingly ordinary man, is drawn into this scheme after encountering Mury, a radical activist who reveals the truth: the power cylinder is not a salvation for Earth, but a tool of exploitation. Mury exposes that Earth has been sold to Mars for labor, with the power cylinder being a symbol of this colonial takeover. He warns that Earth is being turned into a "pool of labor" for the benefit of Martian landowners. To stop this, Mury and Ryd must act immediatelyâ€”before the plan is completed. Ryd is coerced into joining the mission, not out of conviction, but because of the threat of violence and death if he refuses. The plot unfolds with urgency as Ryd and Mury carry out a covert operation, including the murder of a guard and the infiltration of a key facility to disable the power cylinder. The story is not about a grand planetary revolution but a dark, personal confrontation with the consequences of systemic exploitation, where individual action becomes a necessary act of resistance against a corrupt, dehumanizing system.
