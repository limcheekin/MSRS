The story that explores the complexities of marriage and the lengths one man goes to in order to escape domestic troubles is not present in the provided chapters. All the narratives discussed—such as the space colony experience, the psychological struggles of a telepathic prisoner, the Martian mountain mystery, or the haunted house and fountain tale—center on themes of isolation, survival, or psychological conflict, but none involve a marriage or the specific domestic tensions that drive a character to escape. Therefore, there is no plot in the given text about a story involving marital conflict or a man fleeing domestic issues.
