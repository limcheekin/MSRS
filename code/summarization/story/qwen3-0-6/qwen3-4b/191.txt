The story does not mention a "Prime" technology. The provided chapters do not explore a man's frustrations with his marriage or a quest for an alternative to his wife. Instead, the narrative centers on a man's experience of isolation and existential dread during a colonial mission, reflecting on the psychological and physical challenges of space travel and survival on a distant planet. There is no reference to a "Prime" technology or to marital conflict or a search for an alternative to a wife. Therefore, the significance of "Prime" technology in this context is nonexistent.
