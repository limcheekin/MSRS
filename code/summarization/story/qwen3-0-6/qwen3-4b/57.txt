Cassal is on his way to Tunney 21 because, as part of the Ship's colony program, he is scheduled to be dropped on a distant planet at the age of fourteen. This is a rite of passage designed to test survival skills and mental resilience. The Ship's system ensures that every young person undergoes this experience to determine whether they can survive and adapt to harsh, alien environments. Cassal, like others, is sent to a planet such as Tunney 21 to endure a month-long isolation, during which he must rely on himself to survive, find resources, and avoid danger. The mission is not a vacation, but a trial of endurance and self-reliance. This process helps maintain the population's physical and mental strength within the Ship by eliminating those who cannot handle the challenges of survival. Thus, Cassal’s journey to Tunney 21 is a mandatory part of the Ship’s long-term survival strategy, designed to prepare individuals for life beyond Earth and to ensure the colony’s success.
