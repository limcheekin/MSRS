Farquar does not appear in the provided chapters, so there is no effect of Farquar on the narrative or its exploration of morality, power, and conflict between different groups of thinkers in a dystopian future. The story presented in the chapters centers on various individual experiences—such as a young man’s isolation on a planet, a telepathic antagonist’s manipulation, a space pioneer’s journey, and a young woman’s encounter with a ghostly vision—without any reference to a character named Farquar or any thematic development tied to such a figure. Therefore, the question about Farquar has no basis in the given text.
