The story features a peaceful colony on the planet Tintera, which is described as a quiet, forested world with springtime vegetation and a gentle climate. The setting is rural and natural, with rolling hills and a narrow, sandy road marked by horse tracks and vehicle wheels. This environment contrasts sharply with the harsh, alien world of Mars, which the story later introduces as a place of conflict and danger. The peaceful colony on Tintera is established as a haven for the human settlers, where life unfolds through quiet exploration and survival in a natural landscape. The setting emphasizes isolation, with the protagonist riding alone through the countryside, searching for others and seeking a safe place to spend a month. The atmosphere is one of stillness and natural beauty, yet underpinned by tension—especially in the context of the colony’s perilous mission to survive on a hostile, unfamiliar world. The peacefulness of the setting is both a comfort and a vulnerability, as the characters remain exposed to the unknown, making the environment a silent stage for the unfolding threat from an alien presence.
